# Implementation of automotive system reduce bandwidth usage in real time video system.

**Under the Guidance of Dr Umakant P Kulkarni**

## Abstract
_The project is titled “Implementation of automotive system reduce bandwidth usage in real time video system”._

_Wireless sensor networks (WSN) connect small devices, each of which has its own sensing computation and communication components and power sources. The task of such networks which are distributed and adhoc is generally to monitor the environment and collect specific data such as temperature, pressure, and humidity. But such sensors generate a limited amount of information which can be insufficient for many applications even if large sensors are deployed. Hence the need arises for WSNs with multi-dimensional data sensors such as camera sensors to which are referred as visual sensor networks (VSNs). With recent advances in imaging technologies, producing small, low-power, low-cost image/video capture devices at a large scale may be within reach in the foreseeable future._

_Thus this project’s main aim is to reduce network traffic when using real time video services such as video conferencing or surveillance. This can allow for businesses and people to reduce costs and lead a more sustainable and green economy even while using high energy services._

_The project contains 2 main components, mainly, the client-side reconstruction  library and the server-side differentiating and parsing engine. Both will be integrated into the final software._
